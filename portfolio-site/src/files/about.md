### A bit about me...

I first felt empowered by code whilst studying Linguistics, seeing languages like R and Python brought to the research I was passionate about. I tried a bit of R and no one got hurt, but I didn’t start taking tech seriously until my last job, where solving day-to-day problems with self-taught VBA became the best part of my day. I took a deep-dive into JavaScript, and haven’t looked back.
